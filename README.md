# Uber-Data-Analytics-Dashboard-using-Power-BI-connected-to-a-SQL-database
"Built an interactive Uber Data Analytics Dashboard in Power BI connected to a SQL database, enabling real-time insights into rides, revenue, peak hours, locations, and customer trends. Includes dynamic filters, KPIs, and visualizations for data-driven decision-making."
This project focuses on building an interactive Uber Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, with data sourced directly from a SQL database. The main objective is to analyze ride patterns, customer behavior, and trip performance to support data-driven decision-making for transportation and mobility services.

A structured ETL pipeline was implemented where raw trip data—containing details like pickup time, drop-off time, locations, distance, fare amount, and ride category—was imported into a SQL database. SQL queries were used to clean, transform, and aggregate the data, ensuring accuracy and consistency before loading it into Power BI.

In Power BI, multiple visualizations were created to highlight key insights:

Ride Volume Trends: Daily, weekly, and monthly ride counts to understand peak demand periods.

Geographical Insights: Maps displaying hotspots for pickups and drop-offs across different zones.

Revenue & Fare Analysis: Total revenue, average fare, fare distribution, and surge pricing patterns.

Driver Performance Metrics: Total trips per driver, trip completion rate, and earnings breakdown.

Trip Duration & Distance: Average ride durations and distances to understand operational efficiency.

Interactive filters such as time ranges, location filters, ride types, and customer segments allow users to explore the data dynamically.

The dashboard helps stakeholders answer important questions like:

Which areas have the highest demand for rides?

What times of day show peak trip activity?

How does pricing vary across locations and days?

Which drivers contribute most to ride completion?

This project demonstrates practical skills in SQL, data cleaning, ETL, data modeling, and Power BI dashboard development. It showcases the ability to convert raw mobility data into actionable insights that can improve customer experience, optimize operations, and support strategic decisions in the ride-sharing domain.
